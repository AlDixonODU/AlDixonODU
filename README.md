  Hi! I am an Old Dominion University student with a major in Game Design and will be graduating in December 2022. I fell in love with designing games ever since I was a little kid. My love for it grew even more when I played my favorite game, Metroid Prime. That game jump started my growth and understanding of game design in a more detailed perspective. As I had grown older, I became more interested in asset creation and level design. I wanted to create worlds just like my favorite game, fantastical yet grounded. I have recently started to hone in my craft and create things in my own unique style when I started to 3D model in college, using Blender and Maya. Now, as I am getting close to graduating, I want to express my love for it in a professional setting and also learn more about game design.
